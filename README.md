# Bounce Game Engine

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2019 with MSVC (as well as the bin directory added to path)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- SCons Compilation Tool
- CMake Build Tool (for external dependencies)

## Compiling from source
### Windows
Start off by recursively cloning the repository `git clone --recursive https://github.com/BoomerDev/BounceEngine.git` (alternatively you can download the ZIP as well as the external dependencies).

Then enter the `Scripts/` directory and run `Build.bat`.

If all the steps have been completed successfully, there should be a `Binaries/` directory, where you will find your engine executable.
